       . Build Score, following the setps in the README.

       . cd into i-score folder with your terminal.

   ==<[ Linux ]>==
   
        These explanations are for Debian and Debian-related (Mint, Ubuntu...) distributions.
        
        . Download and install the latest Qt from http://qt-project.org/downloads
        
        . Install other libraries and required tools from a package manager : 
        	# apt-get install libgl1-mesa-dev libgecode-dev libxml2-dev libsndfile-dev libportaudio-dev libportmidi-dev ruby git clang-3.4
        	
        . Build JamomaCore : https://github.com/jamoma/JamomaCore on the feature/linux branch
        	% git clone https://github.com/jamoma/JamomaCore
        	% git checkout feature/linux
        	% ruby build.rb Development clean
        	
        	Jamoma shared libraries are installed in /usr/local/lib/jamoma/, so the root password will be asked.
        	
        . Build Score : https://github.com/OSSIA/Score on branch feature/linux, by following the same steps than for Jamoma.

	. Build i-score : 
		First set the path for i-score to find the jamoma includes 
		% export JAMOMA_INCLUDE_PATH=(put here the path to the Jamoma/Core folder)
		% qmake -spec=linux-clang
		% make
		
	. Running (could be put in a .sh) : 
		% export LD_LIBRARY_PATH=$LD_LIBRARY_PATH:/usr/local/lib/jamoma/lib
		% ./i-score
		
       [TBC]
